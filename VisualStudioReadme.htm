    <h1>
        Building resiprocate with Visual Studio 2010</h1>
    <h2>
        Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
        When checked out from SVN, all dependent libraries are included with one 
        exception: You need to download openSSL. You can either download the source and 
        build it or download the precompiled binaries from
        <a href="http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html">
        http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html</a>. You need to download the 
        full versions, the light versions are not sufficient. If you want to build for 
        x64 you need to download the x64 version. </p>
    <p>
        Please note that the x64 version can be installed on x64 machines, but you can 
        copy the install folder to a 32bit system and cross-compile for x64. The openssl 
        install folders need to be renamed and put at the following locations:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Solution Folder<ul>
                <li>contrib<ul>
                    <li>openssl (for Win32)</li>
                    <li>opensslx64 (for x64)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
    <p>
        Additionally, in order to compile reTurn, it is required to have boost in the 
        contrib\boost folder. The latest version that was proofed to compile 
        successfully with Visual Studio 2010 is 1.53.0</p>
    <h2>
        Configurations and Platforms</h2>
    <p>
        There are eight possible configuration/platform combinations: SSL/non-SSL * 
        Debug/Release * x86/x64 = 8</p>
    <p>
        The output of all projects is created in a single folder for each 
        configuration/platform combinations. The output is organized as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Solution Folder<ul>
            <li>Win32<ul>
                <li>Debug</li>
                <li>Release</li>
                <li>SSL-Debug</li>
                <li>SSL-Release</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>X64<ul>
                <li>Debug</li>
                <li>Release</li>
                <li>SSL-Debug</li>
                <li>SSL-Release </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Batch Builds</h2>
    <p>
        The Visual Studio Batch Build feature does not work with the current 
        configuration. This is due to a bug in Visual Studio 2010 when project 
        references are used. It could be solved by removing project references, adding 
        project dependencies instead and specifying all generated import libraries 
        directly in the linker configuration. This would practically resemble the way 
        this was done in pre-VS10 environments, but it would involve a bit of 
        configuration work.</p>
