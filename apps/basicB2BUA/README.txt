WARNING
-------

This is a basic example application that was built 
against an earlier version of libb2bua

The libb2bua code and the resip/dum code has been
updated significantly since this code was written and
tested.

This code is not an official part of reSIProcate.

The main purpose of contributing this code to the
repository is so that people can understand the history
of libb2bua and how it is used.

Using it
--------

The file sample-config.xml allows for configuration
of the peers and routing rules.  All other configuration
is done with command line arguments.
