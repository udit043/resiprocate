Package: libresiprocate-1.10
Architecture: any
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: reSIProcate SIP stack - shared libraries
 reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
 in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
 such as the repro SIP proxy.
 .
 This package provides the core libraries: librutil (utilities),
 libresip (SIP stack/RFC compliant message parsing) and
 libdum (SIP Dialog Usage Manager, a state machine for SIP dialogs).

Description: reSIProcate SIP stack - development files
 reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
 in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
 such as the repro SIP proxy.
 .
 This package provides header files needed for developing applications
 based on the core reSIProcate libraries.

Description: reSIProcate conversation manager - shared libraries
 reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
 in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
 such as the repro SIP proxy.
 .
 This package provides the conversation manager library, librecon,
 implementing the core functionality of a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA),
 session border controller (SBC) and conferencing server.
 .
 As reSIProcate has no built-in media framework, this package depends on the
 media framework from the sipXtapi project.  However, it does not utilise
 any other features of sipXtapi for the session control.  Future versions of
 recon aim to support multiple media frameworks using an abstraction layer.

Description: reSIProcate TURN client (reTurn) - shared libraries
 reTurn is the TURN component of the reSIProcate project.
 This package provides a shared library implementing the TURN
 protocol for NAT traversal, typically used in VoIP applications
 such as SIP and Jabber/XMPP.  It is a successor to STUN and
 is an important part of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
 protocol.
