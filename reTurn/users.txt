# reTurnServer user database file
#
# The format of each line is:
#
#    login:password:realm:state
#
# Typically, the realm field must match the value of AuthenticationRealm
# defined in reTurnServer.config
#
# The state field (not case sensitive) can be one of:
#
#   authorized   (user authorized)
#   refused      (user denied access)
#   restricted   (for when bandwidth limiting is implemented)
#
# This file format is interchangeable with TurnServer.org's user database
#
# Comments can be inserted by starting a line with #
#
test:1234:reTurn:authorized
